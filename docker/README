The g++ and gcc scripts in this directory are used to replace the real g++ and gcc programs so that compilation across all projects (including dependencies) uses the -march=nehalem flag, which allows us to build a docker image compatible with most Intel based CPUs.

Without the -march=nehalem flag, a docker image will contain binaries that are optimized for the machine that built the image, and will not run on older machines.
